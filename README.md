#### Description
This repository, code-notes, is a collection of most of the important things I've learned in my time writing software these last few years. Much of the content comes from forums (mostly stackoverflow), to which the original links (should be) at or near the top of the section they're copy+pasted into. 

I recommend the rust section for cross-compilation and the typescript section for some typescript configs.
